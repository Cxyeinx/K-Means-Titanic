# K-Means Clustering

K-Mean Clustering is a method of clustering of clustering the data into $k$ number of clusters. 

The K-Means starts by placing random centroids, then it optimizes the places of centroids. 

When the places of the $k$ centroids is not moving, we have reached the point where it clustered the data.
